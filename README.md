## Usage

The website displays the weather based on the user's input. The user can enter a city in the left-hand search, which appends to the search history. The weather for the city is then displayed on the right, with the temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV Index for the day at the top and a 5-day forecast below.

Depending on the UV Index, the background color will change. The search history function allows for a user to click on a previously searched city and the dashboard will load the weather for that city.
